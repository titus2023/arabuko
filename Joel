<h1>THE COCONUT INDUSTRY AND YOUTH INVOLVEMENT IN AN INNOVATIVE COCONUT VALUE 

CHAIN</h1>

<p>

The agriculture sector in Kenya contributes directly to the GDP by 30%, and 

indirectly by 27%. It also contributes largely in employment creation and social 

economic development.

<br>

Some of the key challenges facing the coconut production mostly among the coastal 

region are: high cost of production, limited innovation and technology, the aging 

coconut plants, high cost of farm inputs.

<br>

Some key efforts can however be made to address these challenges; introduction of 

subsidies to lower the cost of production, addition of value to the coconut value 

chain, provision of affordable credit channels such as the commodities fund and 

intentional distribution of the coconut seedlings to the farmers by the 

government and non- governmental sector.

<br>

Specifically, there are various issues facing the coconut sector in Kenya; the 

prolonged drought conditions, poor management of the coconut palms, 70% of the 

palms ere senile, limited replanting initiatives, low planting density, coconut 

plantation in Kenya is limited to coastal areas, poor awareness and training, 

approximately 90% of the coconut small- scale farmers are poor, high incidences 

of rhinoceros beetle and lack of motivation due to low nut price and high cost of 

inputs.

<br>

These issues can be addressed through; genetic improvement of the coconut, 

distribution of the drought resistant coconut, training of the farmers, selection 

of the of the local Kenya tall for high yield, proper seedlings selection in 

nurseries to monitor the number of flowers, number of bunches, number of nut per 

bunch to boost their germination speed, proper planting and care of seedlings, 

burial of husks in pits for moisture conservation, supply of water to the coconut during the rain free periods and brochure applications in the management of pest 

and diseases and use of organic manures.

<br>

The farmers are the biggest stakeholders in this sector; however the youths must 

be brought in the equation. The 64% of the Kenyans are youths and almost 50% of 

those youths are unemployed.

<br>

The major challenges to youth participation in the coconut value chain are; 

limited access to land, limited agricultural finance, inadequate of skills and 

information, negative attitude, long maturity of local coconut, limited access to 

agricultural finance, most of the youths have a negative attitude towards farming 

and long maturation of the local coconut discourage the youths to venture in 

coconut production. The youths can however be engaged through ICT integration in 

youth capacity building such as agribiz initiatives, youth na biz initiatives 

which youths can easily relate. Youth empowerment and training is also key; on 

value adition, early maturing hybrid coconut production, intercropping of coconut 

with short duration high value crops, provision of Affirmative Action Funds, 

supporting e- marketing youth related businesses, supporting peer learning and 

carrying out exchange visits in high coconut producing nations such as Sri Lanka, 

promotion of modern technologies and mechanization in the coconut value chain and 

also coming up with agribusiness incubation for youth coconut agri-preneurs to 

encourage more youths to be engaged in agriculture. Youth policies should be 

fully implemented. In that way youths will be engaged.
