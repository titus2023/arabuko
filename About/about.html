<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
Arabuko Farm borders Arabuko Sokoke which is the largest
Fragment of coastal forest (420 square km) in East Africa.
Traditionally. A vast amount of cashew and mango is grown in the area.
Horticulture and maize are growing in the hinterland and along
The Galana river. In the coastal region, like in many other parts of
Kenya, deforestation is taking place at an alarming rate. This is
Mostly because of the lucrative charcoal market. The coastal
Province of Kenya currently has almost 4 million inhabitants, a high percentage of which are subsistence farmers.
Arabuko Farm is heavily intertwined with its community. We hope that our awareness raising through education and training leads to the adoption of a more sustainable business model by local communities.
Furthermore, our objective within the community is to integrate
Fruit trees into the tree mix so that the value of the trees for the
Local population will be higher, as well as sustainable harvesting of
Useful forest products such as tree leaves and natural herbs.

At Arabuko Farm, we have currently planted 2.400 fruit trees and sustainably strive to extend this number within the local community and our farm. Arabuko Farm tries to demonstrate a lionâ€™s share of innovation needed to support the local smallholder towards regenerative agriculture. Secondly, we strive to raise awareness through education and training leading to the adoption of sustainable business models by local communities.</p>

<h3>Our Community</h3>
<p>In 2020 the land of Arabuko Farm was bought by two agriculture consultants who wanted to put their theory into practice. Their
Experience with East African agricultural companies, NGOs, and government agencies showed them the need for knowledge institutions in the form of a demonstration farm. After
2 years of landscape restoration of the degraded land, the first
Fruit was being harvested and the regional farmers started to
Show interest in the innovative practices at Arabuko Farm.
